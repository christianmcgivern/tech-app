Backend API Design
1. Endpoints
Clock-In/Clock-Out
    • Endpoint: /api/technician/clock-in
    • Method: POST
    • Input:
{
  "technician_id": 1,
  "truck_assigned": "Truck-101"
}
    • Logic:
        ◦ Write clock_in_time to the database. 
        ◦ Trigger the AI agent with a greeting. 
    • Example Code:
from datetime import datetime

@app.post("/api/technician/clock-in")
def clock_in(data: dict):
    technician_id = data['technician_id']
    truck_assigned = data['truck_assigned']

    # Update Database
    db.execute(
        """
        UPDATE technicians SET clock_in_time = %s, truck_assigned = %s
        WHERE technician_id = %s
        """,
        (datetime.now(), truck_assigned, technician_id)
    )

    return {"message": "Clock-in successful."}
Work Order Summary
    • Endpoint: /api/work-orders/summary
    • Method: GET
    • Logic:
        ◦ Query work orders for the day. 
        ◦ Return details in JSON format. 
    • Example Query:
SELECT * FROM work_orders WHERE status = 'Pending';

AI Interaction Workflow
1. Voice Input Processing
Speech-to-Text (STT)
    • When the technician speaks, the voice input is captured using WebRTC. 
    • The audio stream is sent to the Whisper API for transcription. 
    • Example Code for Whisper Integration: 
import openai

def transcribe_audio(audio_file):
    response = openai.Audio.transcriptions.create(
        file=audio_file,
        model="whisper-1"
    )
    return response['text']
2. AI Agent Logic
    • GPT-4o Realtime Interaction:
        ◦ Process the transcribed text and generate a conversational response. 
        ◦ The AI queries the database as needed to fetch or update information. 
        ◦ Example conversation: 
            ▪ Technician: "Show me today's work orders." 
            ▪ AI: Queries the database and responds with a summary. 
    • Code Example for GPT-4o Interaction:
import openai

def get_ai_response(user_input, context):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": user_input}
        ] + context
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
3. Database Integration for AI
    • The AI agent interacts with the database via APIs to: 
        1. Fetch work orders. 
        2. Update job statuses. 
        3. Log technician notes. 
Logic for Database Updates
    • AI takes input like: "Mark the job with ID 123 as completed." 
    • Backend receives this command, updates the database, and confirms the change. 
    • Example Code: 
@app.post("/api/work-orders/update")
def update_work_order(data: dict):
    work_order_id = data['work_order_id']
    status = data['status']

    # Update the database
    db.execute(
        """
        UPDATE work_orders SET status = %s WHERE work_order_id = %s
        """,
        (status, work_order_id)
    )

    return {"message": "Work order updated successfully."}
4. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
    • The AI’s response is converted into audio for the technician. 
    • Example Code for TTS: 
import requests

def generate_speech(text):
    response = requests.post(
        'https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech',
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {OPENAI_API_KEY}"},
        json={
            "model": "tts-1",
            "input": text,
            "voice": "alloy"
        }
    )
    return response.content
5. Combined Workflow Example
Scenario: Work Order Update via Voice
    1. Technician: "Mark job ID 123 as completed." 
    2. STT: Convert voice to text. 
    3. AI: Process input and generate the command to update the database. 
    4. Database: Update the work order status. 
    5. TTS: Convert confirmation message to audio: "Job ID 123 marked as completed." 

Realtime API Integration
1. Setting Up WebSocket
Connection
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();

const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
    },
});

ws.on('open', () => {
    console.log('Connection opened');
});

ws.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log('Message received:', message);
});
Sending Events
    • Example to start a conversation: 
const event = {
    type: "conversation.item.create",
    item: {
        type: "message",
        role: "user",
        content": "Good Morning!"
    }
};
ws.send(JSON.stringify(event));
Handling Responses
    • Example to handle AI responses: 
ws.on('message', (message) => {
    const parsedMessage = JSON.parse(message);
    console.log('AI Response:', parsedMessage);
});

Frontend Design
Technician Interface
    • Mobile-first design with dropdowns and large buttons for: 
        ◦ Selecting technician name. 
        ◦ Selecting assigned truck. 
        ◦ Starting and ending tasks. 
Office Staff Interface
    • Role-based dashboard for: 
        ◦ Viewing work order statuses. 
        ◦ Managing inventory. 
        ◦ Notifying technicians. 

Security and Scalability
1. Security
    • Use ephemeral API keys for client-side interactions. 
    • Store sensitive keys securely using environment variables. 
2. Scalability
    • Use PostgreSQL’s replication for database redundancy. 
    • Deploy backend services with container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

Coding Logic for Workflow Implementation
1. Initial Setup
    • Database: 
        ◦ Ensure the PostgreSQL database is set up with all the defined schemas. 
        ◦ Populate initial data for testing purposes (e.g., sample technicians, work orders). 
    • API Keys: 
        ◦ Securely configure Whisper, GPT-4o, and TTS API keys. 
    • Frontend: 
        ◦ Design an intuitive interface with mock workflows for technician testing. 
2. Voice-Driven Workflow Logic
    • Capture technician’s voice input via WebRTC. 
    • Process the input through Whisper API: 
audio_transcript = transcribe_audio("input_audio_file")
print(f"Transcription: {audio_transcript}")
    • Use GPT-4o to interpret and generate responses based on context: 
context = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "Assist technician with daily workflow."}
]
response = get_ai_response(audio_transcript, context)
print(f"AI Response: {response}")
    • Interact with the database as needed: 
if "mark job" in audio_transcript.lower():
    job_id = extract_job_id(audio_transcript)
    update_work_order({"work_order_id": job_id, "status": "Completed"})
    • Convert AI’s response to speech: 
audio_response = generate_speech(response)
play_audio(audio_response)
3. Job Completion Workflow
    • Technician confirms job completion. 
    • Update work order status and log completion time in the database. 
    • Example sequence: 
completion_data = {
    "work_order_id": 456,
    "status": "Completed",
    "notes": "All tasks finished without issues."
}
update_work_order(completion_data)
    • Notify office staff of any issues (e.g., damaged equipment). 
4. End-of-Day Process
    • AI reviews the day’s work orders: 
day_summary = fetch_day_summary(technician_id)
generate_speech(f"Summary of today: {day_summary}")
    • Record final clock-out time: 
db.execute(
    """
    UPDATE technicians SET clock_out_time = %s WHERE technician_id = %s
    """,
    (datetime.now(), technician_id)
)
This comprehensive logic ties together the database, AI, and voice interaction, ensuring a seamless technician workflow.

Office Staff Frontend Design and Workflow
Overview
This document outlines the design and functionality of the office staff frontend, including the following pages:
    1. Dashboard 
    2. Work Orders 
    3. Technicians 
    4. Trucks 
The frontend will be modern, designed with an Apple-inspired aesthetic, using React for dynamic updates. It will dynamically update without requiring manual page refreshes and will be hosted on a separate server from the technician’s frontend for redundancy and scalability.

Page-by-Page Design
1. Dashboard
Features:
    • Display the total number of alerts prominently. 
    • List all active alerts with details (e.g., broken equipment, low inventory). 
    • Display today’s work orders, including status (Pending, In Progress, Completed). 
    • A navigation tab showing the number of alerts as a badge (e.g., "Dashboard (3)"). 
React Component Example:
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function Dashboard() {
    const [alerts, setAlerts] = useState([]);
    const [workOrders, setWorkOrders] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {
        // Fetch alerts and work orders dynamically
        axios.get('/api/alerts').then(response => setAlerts(response.data));
        axios.get('/api/work-orders/today').then(response => setWorkOrders(response.data));
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Dashboard</h1>
            <h2>Alerts ({alerts.length})</h2>
            <ul>
                {alerts.map(alert => (
                    <li key={alert.id}>{alert.message}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>

            <h2>Today's Work Orders</h2>
            <ul>
                {workOrders.map(order => (
                    <li key={order.id}>{order.description} - {order.status}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Dashboard;

2. Work Orders
Features:
    • List all work orders with filters (e.g., by status, technician, or date). 
    • Allow office staff to add, edit, or remove work orders. 
React Component Example:
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function WorkOrders() {
    const [workOrders, setWorkOrders] = useState([]);
    const [newOrder, setNewOrder] = useState("");

    useEffect(() => {
        // Fetch work orders
        axios.get('/api/work-orders').then(response => setWorkOrders(response.data));
    }, []);

    const addWorkOrder = () => {
        axios.post('/api/work-orders', { description: newOrder }).then(() => {
            setWorkOrders([...workOrders, { description: newOrder, status: "Pending" }]);
            setNewOrder("");
        });
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Work Orders</h1>
            <ul>
                {workOrders.map(order => (
                    <li key={order.id}>{order.description} - {order.status}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>

            <input
                type="text"
                placeholder="New Work Order"
                value={newOrder}
                onChange={e => setNewOrder(e.target.value)}
            />
            <button onClick={addWorkOrder}>Add Work Order</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default WorkOrders;

3. Technicians
Features:
    • List all technicians with their details (e.g., name, assigned truck). 
    • Allow office staff to add, edit, or remove technicians. 
React Component Example:
function Technicians() {
    const [technicians, setTechnicians] = useState([]);
    const [newTechnician, setNewTechnician] = useState("");

    useEffect(() => {
        axios.get('/api/technicians').then(response => setTechnicians(response.data));
    }, []);

    const addTechnician = () => {
        axios.post('/api/technicians', { name: newTechnician }).then(() => {
            setTechnicians([...technicians, { name: newTechnician }]);
            setNewTechnician("");
        });
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Technicians</h1>
            <ul>
                {technicians.map(tech => (
                    <li key={tech.id}>{tech.name}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>

            <input
                type="text"
                placeholder="New Technician"
                value={newTechnician}
                onChange={e => setNewTechnician(e.target.value)}
            />
            <button onClick={addTechnician}>Add Technician</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Technicians;

    • Allow office staff to add, edit, or remove trucks. 
React Component Example:
function Trucks() {
    const [trucks, setTrucks] = useState([]);
    const [newTruck, setNewTruck] = useState("");

    useEffect(() => {
        axios.get('/api/trucks').then(response => setTrucks(response.data));
    }, []);

    const addTruck = () => {
        axios.post('/api/trucks', { description: newTruck }).then(() => {
            setTrucks([...trucks, { description: newTruck }]);
            setNewTruck("");
        });
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Trucks</h1>
            <ul>
                {trucks.map(truck => (
                    <li key={truck.id}>{truck.description}</li>

            <button onClick={addTruck}>Add Truck</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Trucks;

Dynamic Updates
    • React’s useEffect and state hooks ensure real-time updates. 
    • Use WebSocket for instantaneous changes without page refresh. 
WebSocket Example:
useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:4000');

    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
        const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
        if (data.type === "alert_update") {
            setAlerts(data.alerts);
        }
    };

    return () => ws.close();
}, []);

Server Design
    • Separate server for office staff frontend to ensure redundancy. 
    • Backend APIs for office tasks (e.g., /api/work-orders, /api/technicians, /api/trucks). 

Additional Features
    • Authentication: Role-based access control for office staff. 
    • Error Handling: Display error messages for API failures. 
    • Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure the design is responsive for mobile devices. 

Detailed Workflow Logic with Example Code
Overview of Workflow
Technician Workflow
    1. Technician Login and Initialization:
        ◦ The technician opens the REST website/app on their phone. 
        ◦ The interface displays: 
            ▪ Dropdown menu for selecting the technician’s name. 
            ▪ Dropdown menu for selecting the assigned truck (filtered by technician authorization). 
            ▪ "Start Day" button. 
        ◦ Technician selects their name and truck, then clicks "Start Day." 
    2. Clock-In:
        ◦ The app records the clock-in time and date and writes it to the database. 
        ◦ This action triggers the AI agent to start a hands-free interaction. 
    3. AI-Guided Workflow:
        ◦ The AI agent greets the technician and asks: 
            ▪ "Good Morning, [Technician Name]! Ready to start your day?" 
        ◦ Technician responds with "Yes." 
    4. Work Order Summary:
        ◦ AI queries the database to retrieve pending work orders for the day. 
        ◦ AI asks if the technician wants a summary of the work orders: 
            ▪ If "Yes": AI provides a summary from the database. 
            ▪ If "No": AI skips and asks if the technician is ready to travel to the first jobsite. 
    5. Travel Tracking:
        ◦ Technician confirms readiness to travel. 
        ◦ The app records the travel start time. 
        ◦ Upon arrival, the technician clicks "I arrived" in the app: 
            ▪ Travel end time is recorded. 
            ▪ AI resumes interaction and offers a summary of the specific work order. 
    6. Job Start and Completion:
        ◦ Technician starts the job; the app records the job start time. 
        ◦ Upon job completion, the technician clicks "End Job": 
            ▪ AI prompts questions: 
                • "Was everything completed?" 
                • "Are there any notes?" 
                • "Was anything broken?" 
                • "Was extra material used?" 
                • "Should the office be alerted?" 
            ▪ AI updates the database based on technician responses. 
    7. End of Day:
        ◦ Technician completes all jobs and clicks "End Day." 
        ◦ AI checks inventory and alerts the technician about low stock. 
        ◦ Clock-out time is recorded. 

Enhanced Code Logic with Realtime API Specifications
1. Technician Selection and Truck Assignment
Frontend Code (React Example):
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function TechnicianLogin() {
    const [technicians, setTechnicians] = useState([]);
    const [trucks, setTrucks] = useState([]);
    const [selectedTechnician, setSelectedTechnician] = useState("");
    const [selectedTruck, setSelectedTruck] = useState("");

    useEffect(() => {
        // Fetch technicians and authorized trucks
        axios.get('/api/technicians').then(response => setTechnicians(response.data));
        axios.get('/api/trucks').then(response => setTrucks(response.data));
    }, []);

    const handleStartDay = () => {
        axios.post('/api/technician/clock-in', {
            technician_id: selectedTechnician,
            truck_assigned: selectedTruck,
        }).then(response => alert(response.data.message));
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Technician Login</h1>
            <select onChange={e => setSelectedTechnician(e.target.value)}>
                <option value="">Select Technician</option>
                {technicians.map(tech => (
                    <option key={tech.id} value={tech.id}>{tech.name}</option>
                ))}
            </select>

            <select onChange={e => setSelectedTruck(e.target.value)}>
                <option value="">Select Truck</option>
                {trucks.map(truck => (
                    <option key={truck.id} value={truck.id}>{truck.name}</option>
                ))}
            </select>

            <button onClick={handleStartDay}>Start Day</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default TechnicianLogin;
2. Clock-In Logic with Ephemeral Token Support
Backend Code (FastAPI):
from datetime import datetime
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import psycopg2
import secrets

app = FastAPI()

# Database connection
conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=service_db user=admin password=secret")
cursor = conn.cursor()

class ClockInRequest(BaseModel):
    technician_id: int
    truck_assigned: str

@app.post("/api/technician/clock-in")
def clock_in(data: ClockInRequest):
    try:
        # Insert clock-in time
        cursor.execute(
            """
            UPDATE technicians SET clock_in_time = %s, truck_assigned = %s
            WHERE technician_id = %s
            """,
            (datetime.now(), data.truck_assigned, data.technician_id)
        )
        conn.commit()

        # Generate ephemeral token for WebRTC connection
        token = secrets.token_hex(16)
        return {"message": "Clock-in successful.", "webrtc_token": token}
    except Exception as e:
        conn.rollback()

3. WebSocket Logic with Retry and Error Handling
WebSocket Implementation:
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();

function createWebSocketConnection() {
    const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime', {
        headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
        },
    });

    ws.on('open', () => {
        console.log('WebSocket connection opened');
    });

    ws.on('message', (message) => {
        const parsedMessage = JSON.parse(message);
        console.log('Message received:', parsedMessage);
    });

    ws.on('error', (error) => {
        console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
    });

    ws.on('close', () => {
        console.warn('WebSocket connection closed. Retrying...');
        setTimeout(createWebSocketConnection, 5000); // Retry after 5 seconds
    });
}

createWebSocketConnection();
4. AI Workflow Extensions with Function Calling
Dynamic Event Handling in AI Workflow:
import openai

def handle_ai_interaction(user_input):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": user_input}
        ],
        functions=[
            {
                "name": "update_work_order",
                "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {
                    "work_order_id": {"type": "integer"},
                    "status": {"type": "string"}
                }}
            }
        ]
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
