# Step 6: Testing and Debugging

## Overview
This document outlines the testing and debugging process for the AI-Powered Technician Workflow System.

## Tasks

### 1. Unit Testing
- [ ] Develop unit tests for each module.
- [ ] Ensure coverage of all critical functions.

### 2. Integration Testing
- [ ] Test interactions between modules.
- [ ] Validate end-to-end functionality.

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] Optimize resource usage.

### 4. Edge Case Handling
- [ ] Test and handle edge cases.
- [ ] Ensure robustness and reliability.

## Next Steps
After completing testing and debugging:
1. Prepare for deployment.
2. Finalize documentation and training materials.

## Notes
- Use pytest for testing.
- Implement logging for test results and errors.
